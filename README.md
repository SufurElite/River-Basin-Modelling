# River-Basin-Modelling
This is a github repository containing code for the mathematical modelling of Fractal River Basins and the effects of Climate Change on them written for MX4553.

## To-do
- [ ] Download dataset of river satellite images
- [ ] Create an ML model to find the river in the image and binarize it
- [ ] For each waterway, find the fractal dimension with the current methodology and derive the graph 
- [ ] Given the graph, we can create a sample space for "buckets" of fractal dimensions to create a way to sample a probabilities for fractals of similar dimension when generating  a river
- [ ] Integrate the sampling method with the current generation
